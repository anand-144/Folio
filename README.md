Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This website showcases my work and projects, utilizing a combination of ReactJS, SCSS, Sanity for content management, and Frame Motion for animations. The website is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across various devices.

**SCSS:** SCSS (Sass) is used for styling, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability of the stylesheet.
**Sanity:** Content management is handled through Sanity, providing a flexible and customizable backend for managing project data, blog posts, and more.
**Frame Motion:** Frame Motion is utilized for animations, enhancing the visual appeal and interactivity of the website.
